let ac = new Array(2,3123, "jay"); 

// it is not recommended 

one problem
also new Array(3); 
// it is the size of the array it will think 
// single value as size 


let a = [2,4,6,8]; 

these are not at contiguously allocated 
unlike c++



because 

we can hold any datatype 
in c++ we can hold only one datatype in array 


so due to this suppose if we replace string with 
object it requires more space 

in runtime the datatype is defined 
not like compile in c++


in c++ integer in array will be replace by the integer only
