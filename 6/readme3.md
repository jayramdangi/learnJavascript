// replace 

let str10 = "hello ji kaise ho "; 
console.log(str10.replace("ji", "money")); 

it replaces  the first ji occurency with money 
// replaceAll replaces all occurrences 

// replace and replaceall returns the new 
string it does not modifies the original one 





let str11= "Money , honey , sunny, funny"; 

how can we convert this string to array 

str11.split(','); 

now it will create array on the basis of comma 
and return it 
, is the delimitter here 
// you can use anything to split 
// ! or anyting 





let str12 = "   hello ji"; 

// if we want to remove space 
str12.trim(); 

str12().length;


// if you want to trim the begin or end specific 
str12.trimStart(); 
str12.trimEnd(); 



// new way to create a string 

let latestWay = new String("hello"); 

console.log(latestWay); 

[String: 'hello']; 

// now it is also string but this is object 
when you check it's type of 
it is object 

now it takes memory inside the heap 

// n

i am not saying they are object but they inherit the obj.prototype

Ah! Now you're talking about prototypes, which is a deeper and excellent point â€” letâ€™s clarify it precisely:

âœ… You're partially right, but hereâ€™s the full technical picture:
ðŸ”¹ Primitive strings do not directly inherit from Object.prototype.
But when you access a property or method (like .length or .toUpperCase()), JavaScript temporarily wraps the primitive in a String object, and that wrapper object does inherit from String.prototype, which in turn inherits from Object.prototype.

ðŸ§  Inheritance chain (when accessing properties):
javascript
Copy code
"hello"         // primitive
â†“ auto-boxed to
new String("hello")  â†’  inherits from String.prototype
                            â†“
                     inherits from Object.prototype
So when you do:

js
Copy code
"hello".length;
It works because:

"hello" is temporarily converted to new String("hello")

.length is looked up on String.prototype

If not found there, it would go to Object.prototype via the prototype chain

ðŸ§ª You can verify this:
js
Copy code
console.log(typeof "hello");                 // "string" â†’ primitive
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf("hello")); // String.prototype
console.log("hello".__proto__ === String.prototype); // true
console.log(String.prototype.__proto__ === Object.prototype); // true
âœ… Conclusion:
Primitives like strings donâ€™t initially inherit from Object.prototype.

But due to auto-boxing, they temporarily act like objects and use the prototype chain:
String.prototype â†’ Object.prototype.

Your understanding is heading in the right direction â€” just note the distinction between primitive and its temporary object wrapper.
