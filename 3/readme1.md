// we have learned about the primitives 



// non primitive data type 


Array , Object , function , Date 



Array 
to store multiple data in a single variable 

let n =10; 
let n2= 20; 
let n3 = 50; 

array can hold different data types also unlike c++
console.log(arr); 

typeof arr

// it will give us the object 
// because of internal implementation 
// will study in upcoming lectures 





Object 

it stores in key value pair 

let a ={
      name:"jay",
     account_number: 939448, 
     balance : 420
}


why object  
because collectively we want to send the data 
and also ek type ka data ek sath rahe 


if we store in array 
we don't know what is what and in object we can even send in different sequence 
because in array we have iterate one by one 



and also it saves the call of the backend 
because we take the data onces not call again and again 



we can assign function to the variable also 

let fun = function()
{
     console.log("Hello Coder army");
}; 

typeof fun will be the function only 

fun();
