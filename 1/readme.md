what is the need of js in web

we can design by css , structure by html 
but if we want to make calculator 
then we have to add logic 
that do this change this and all 


javascript

it is a programming language

html css javascript


in browser 
it runs the js code 

by v8 engine that can understands the js code

in backend there is no browser so we use node.js 
which has v8 engine code + libuv 
will be studied in backend 


js is developed by the netscape

microsoft stole the code 
and make it's language jscript 


netscape browser uses
javascript 

internetExplorer 
uses jscript 

so we want some common standards 

ecma is the assosciation of europe 

now standaraization 
like 
3++4 
is 3 to power -4 and 3 to power 4 in js and jscript respecitvely 

so browser implement things by their  own 

but the ES6 or ecmascript 6 are the standarization
