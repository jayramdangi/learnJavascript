🔍 Before V8 (Chrome):
Before Google Chrome introduced the V8 engine (2008), browsers like Internet Explorer used their own JavaScript engines. For Internet Explorer, it was called:

JScript engine (part of Trident engine)

This engine interpreted JavaScript but was much slower because:

It didn’t optimize the code much.

It didn’t use Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation.

It parsed and executed code line by line, like an interpreter.

v8 has c++ 
and also jscript has c++

v8 is not a compiler not a interpreter 
it is jit 


compiler :-  converts to machine code

jsengine--> it converts js code to machine code 

v8 is the most famous jsengine 


js engine or v8 
is written in the c++
70=75 percent c++ 
because it is fast ;
