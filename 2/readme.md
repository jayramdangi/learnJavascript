datatypes in javascript 

how to declare the variables 

let num=10; 
console.log(num); 


data is loaded into ram 
random access memory 


let num =10; 
let a =70; 
// above are stored in memory 



datatypes : 
primitive data types 
non primitive data types 



let num ; 
num can be number , string , boolean , bigint, 
null , undefined , symbol 

everythin is number in js 10, 20 , 20.00, 500.26
string is the like comment "hello coder"
boolean is the true/false 
string can be written in "" or '' or ``

you can check typeof num



primitive data type 

number, boolean , string , null , undefined, symbol, bigint 

let acc = 30; 
console.log(typeof account_balance); 

let str ="rohit";
console.log(str); 

; is not necessary in js 


let a = undefined ; 

// undefined is that we have not assign anything 
// here 
// even if we do let account; 
/// then also account will be  undefined

// let bal = null;
//  console.log(bal); 
// it will print null
//  null means i have assigned nothing to it 

// suppose we have to check account balance 
// we request to bank 
// undefien means no account 
// null means can't show 
// we can't show 0 


type of null is object 

that is the error of the javascript 
the type of every primitive is itself only except 
the null

and it is not change because 
old legacy codes 


/// bigint 


let a = 830484848499448824804848084;

// now it will print as .e+24 and all it will 
// not show exact value 

let a = 830484848499448824804848084n; 
// now it will print full;


// number : 

64bit/8 = 8 byte 
are given to any number to store small or big 

and if number requires 68 bit then it starts wrapping it up 


2to the power 53 is the highest number 

Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER;
Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER;

bigint me kitna bhi bada store kar sakte hai no limit
