prototype chaining 

most important interview topic of js 


const arr= [10, 20 , 30]; 

arr.__proto__ 

// it is the prototype of the array 
// where there is every property of the array 

array is object 
then where does this .push comes 
even object does not has this because it has 
Object.__protottype__ 

and its also 







how does the array get the push 

what happens when we do arr.push(9); 
// where does this push comes from 

before that 

let obj={
    "jay":"dangi",
}



obj.toString(); 
// now where does toString comes from 


// so apart from these keys obj has other things also 

console.log(obj.toString()); 

// so where does push coming from array 
// inbuilt function 
// not expected this answer

// okay builtin but where they are coming from 


const a = [3,4,10, 12]; 
// now many more properties comes with this 
// because it is array 
a.__proto__

// now you write above statement you will get all the 
// props of array 



// if we make a object 
const obj = {
    a:1, b:2,
}

obj.__proto__
it gives all the props of object 
like 
hasOwnProperty 
constructor 
toString
findIndex;


now that obj can access all this property 


let user1 = {
    name:"Rohit", 
    age:20
}
let user2 = {
    amount:20, 
    money:50
}


user2.__proto__ = user1; 

now it inherits the properties of user1 also 
and its own propertyr can also access 
user2.name will give rohit 



so if we inherit from Object.prototype 
then the properties of object will also be there 
and also their own property 


i want only most important topics in very very depth don't give unnecessary or very less imp topic

Thought for 5s
Nice — I’ll give only the most important prototype-chain topics, each explored deeply and practically (no fluff). Read these as the 9 core pillars you must know for interviews — understand the examples and be able to type/trace them in a console.

1 — Core distinction: [[Prototype]] (instance) vs .prototype (constructor)
What:

Every object has an internal link [[Prototype]] (the delegation target). You can read it with Object.getPrototypeOf(obj) or obj.__proto__.

Every function has a .prototype property. When you call new F(), the created object’s [[Prototype]] is set to F.prototype.
Why it matters: interviewers test confusion here — .prototype is not the same as obj.__proto__.
Example & check:

js
Copy code
function F(){} 
const o = new F();
Object.getPrototypeOf(o) === F.prototype; // true
o.__proto__ === F.prototype; // true (works, but prefer Object.getPrototypeOf)
Tip: Object.prototype is the top normal prototype; Object.getPrototypeOf(Object.prototype) === null.

2 — Exactly what new does (step-by-step) — must be memorized and reproducible
Steps new Constr(...args) performs:

Create a fresh empty object obj.

Set obj.[[Prototype]] = Constr.prototype.

Call Constr with this = obj: let result = Constr.apply(obj, args).

If result is an object (non-null) return it; otherwise return obj.
Why: shows why constructors can return objects and why prototype methods are shared.
Important edge: primitive returns from constructor are ignored.
Demonstration:

js
Copy code
function A(){ this.v = 1; }
A.prototype.m = () => 'proto';
const a = new A();
a.v; // 1
a.m(); // 'proto'
3 — Property lookup algorithm & shadowing (how exactly lookup happens)
Algorithm (precise):

For obj.prop:

If obj has own property prop, return it.

Else look at proto = Object.getPrototypeOf(obj); repeat step 1 on proto.

Continue until proto === null. If not found, return undefined.
Shadowing: assigning obj.prop = x creates/updates an own property; it does not change prototype properties unless the property is an accessor (setter) on prototype.
Example (trace):

js
Copy code
const g = { g: 'G' };
const p = Object.create(g); p.p = 'P';
const c = Object.create(p); c.c = 'C';

c.c; // 'C' (own)
c.p; // 'P' (from p)
c.g; // 'G' (from g)
c.toString; // from Object.prototype
Pitfall to explain in interview: delete obj.prop removes own prop and may reveal prototype prop with same name.

4 — Where to put methods vs state (memory & correctness)
Rule of thumb (must state and explain):

State (mutable per-instance) → set inside constructor: this.items = [].

Behavior (methods) → place on prototype: Ctor.prototype.add = function(){...}.
Why: methods on prototype are shared (saves memory), state on prototype is shared (bug).
Classic bug example:

js
Copy code
function C(){ }
C.prototype.arr = []; // BAD — shared
const a = new C();
const b = new C();
a.arr.push(1);
b.arr; // [1] — unexpected
Fix: function C(){ this.arr = []; }

5 — Implementations you must be ready to code (and explain complexity)
A. myNew (interview classic) — implement + explain why Object.create is used and why returned-object handling is needed:

js
Copy code
function myNew(Constr, ...args){
  if (typeof Constr !== 'function') throw new TypeError('Not a constructor');
  const obj = Object.create(Constr.prototype);     // step 1-2
  const res = Constr.apply(obj, args);            // step 3
  return (res !== null && (typeof res === 'object' || typeof res === 'function')) ? res : obj;
}
B. myInstanceof — how instanceof walks chain:

js
Copy code
function myInstanceof(obj, Constr){
  if (obj == null) return false;
  let proto = Object.getPrototypeOf(obj);
  const target = Constr.prototype;
  while(proto !== null){
    if (proto === target) return true;
    proto = Object.getPrototypeOf(proto);
  }
  return false;
}
C. Object.create polyfill (why it works):

js
Copy code
function polyCreate(proto){
  if (proto === null) {
    // create object with null prototype
    const obj = {};
    Object.setPrototypeOf(obj, null);
    return obj;
  }
  function F(){}
  F.prototype = proto;
  return new F();
}
Complexities: property lookup is O(k) where k = chain length; myInstanceof likewise O(k).

6 — Inheritance patterns you must articulate (and when to use each)
A. Constructor + prototype (classic):

js
Copy code
function Parent(name){ this.name = name; }
Parent.prototype.say = function(){ return this.name; };
function Child(name, id){
  Parent.call(this, name);            // inherit instance state
  this.id = id;
}
Child.prototype = Object.create(Parent.prototype); // inherit prototype methods
Child.prototype.constructor = Child;
Child.prototype.getId = function(){ return this.id; };
Why this is used: mixes per-instance state and shared methods; explain Parent.call(this, ...) and Object.create role.
B. Pure prototypal (delegation) style: const obj = Object.create(proto) — simple delegation, no new. Use for simple object factories or when you want an object with a specific delegate.
C. class sugar (ES6): syntactic sugar — methods go on Class.prototype, extends sets prototype chain for instances and statics:

js
Copy code
class P { method(){} }
class C extends P { }
Object.getPrototypeOf(C.prototype) === P.prototype; // true
Object.getPrototypeOf(C) === P; // for static inheritance
Important to mention: class is not a new inheritance model — explain equivalent prototype setup.

7 — instanceof, .isPrototypeOf, .hasOwnProperty — semantics & gotchas
obj instanceof C → true iff C.prototype is in obj’s prototype chain.

C.prototype.isPrototypeOf(obj) → same test (explicit form).

obj.hasOwnProperty(name) → checks own property only (skip prototypes).
Gotcha: instanceof depends on function’s .prototype object, so if you reassign Ctor.prototype after creating instances, instanceof behavior changes accordingly. Also instanceof can be broken across realms (iframes) if constructors differ.

8 — Important edge cases & interview gotchas (must know & be able to explain)
A. Accessors on prototype (setter invoked instead of creating own prop):

js
Copy code
const proto = { set x(v){ this._x = v; } };
const o = Object.create(proto);
o.x = 5; // calls proto's setter; may mutate prototype's logic
B. Non-enumerable & for...in: for...in iterates enumerable own + inherited properties — always filter with hasOwnProperty. Object.keys returns own enumerable only. Object.getOwnPropertyNames returns non-enumerable too.
C. Symbols: Symbol keys are also looked up via prototype chain. Use Object.getOwnPropertySymbols.
D. Object.setPrototypeOf(obj, proto) — works but slow; can deoptimize engines; prefer creating object with correct prototype initially.
E. constructor property: not guaranteed; if you replace Ctor.prototype = Object.create(...) you must reset .constructor = Ctor if you rely on it.
F. Static inheritance: ClassB.__proto__ === ClassA after class B extends A — explains how static methods are inherited.
G. Object.create(null) → pure dictionary without Object.prototype (no inherited keys like toString) — used for safe maps.
H. Prototype pollution (security): assigning to __proto__ or merging user-controlled keys into objects can set Object.prototype properties — important to mention briefly in interviews as a risk.

9 — Minimal but critical practice checklist (what to type and explain in 60–90 seconds)
Show new internals: type a simple constructor, add method on prototype, show Object.getPrototypeOf and instanceof.

Demonstrate shadowing: set property on instance, delete it, show prototype value revealed.

Implement myNew or myInstanceof live — explain each line.

Show shared-array bug and fix it.

Show class extends equivalent to prototype code (type class then show Object.getPrototypeOf relationships).

Quick one-paragraph script you can deliver in interview (exact words)
“In JS every object has an internal [[Prototype]] link used for property lookup. Functions have a .prototype object which becomes the [[Prototype]] of instances created by new. new creates an object, sets its prototype to Ctor.prototype, calls the constructor with that object as this and returns either the constructor’s returned object or the created object. Property access walks the chain until null. Put per-instance state inside constructors and shared methods on the prototype, never mutable objects on the prototype. instanceof checks if Ctor.prototype is in the chain. Prefer Object.create(proto) to build delegation-based objects. Avoid changing prototypes on hot objects with Object.setPrototypeOf due to deoptimizations, and be aware of prototype pollution risks.”

If you want, I’ll now:

(A) Give exactly 5 live code snippets you can paste into console (with expected output) — or

(B) Give three compact one-minute answers you can memorize for “What is prototype?”, “What does new do?”, and “Difference between __proto__ and .prototype?”

Pick A or B (I’ll proceed immediately).







You said:
what is delegation and internal link in first one 


ChatGPT said:

Thought for a few seconds
Short answer:

Internal link ([[Prototype]]) is the hidden reference every object has that points to another object (or null). You can read it with Object.getPrototypeOf(obj) or obj.__proto__.

Delegation means when you try to access a property on an object, JavaScript delegates the lookup to that internal link — if the property isn’t found on the object itself, the engine asks the prototype, then the prototype’s prototype, and so on.

Tiny example (type in console):

js
Copy code
const parent = { a: 1 };
const child = Object.create(parent); // child.[[Prototype]] -> parent
child.b = 2;

console.log(child.a);                 // 1  <-- delegated to parent via [[Prototype]]
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(child) === parent); // true
parent.a = 3;
console.log(child.a);                 // 3  <-- live delegation (reflects changes in parent)
So delegation = property lookup handed off along the object’s internal link ([[Prototype]]) until found (or null).
