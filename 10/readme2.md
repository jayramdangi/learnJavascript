// can we give key name as a number 
// yes we can give but it will be stored as string 
// only and then it can be accessed by only 
// square bracket 
// we can't access by dot operator 

// but one benefit with the number is 
// we can access without string in square bracket 
// obj[0] is valid 
// if 0 is a key in obj 

// so that is the implementation of array 


// and when we see it in consoel 
// it also looks like the array 
// 0: value 
// 1: value 
// 2 : value 



so array also uses that key pair only 
like object is using 


length is the key of the array and in many things


so array is implemented as a object only 

 
 so object was already implemented 

 array is built over top of it 





// undefined can also be key of object 
// obj.undefined 
// null can also be taken 


const person = new Object(); 

// property add
person.name = "Rohit"; 
person.age= 80; 
person.gender="Male"; 
console.log(person);

delete person.age to delete 

update 
person.age = 40; 
// if exists then update 
// if not then it will create 



// new constructor call karta hai 


const obj 
can also update it can not be assigned with 
other object's address
