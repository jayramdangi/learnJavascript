Object 

the Object type represents one of the js data types 
it is used to store various keyed collections and the 



// how to create object 

const obj = {
      
    name   : "jayram dangi",
    id: 20,        
}

console.log(obj); 

const insta ={
     insta_id:"rohit_negi9",
     password: "1q2w3e4r5t6y",
     gender: "male"
}

console.log(obj.insta_id); 

// so we can access like it


key is stored as the string in backend(internal); 
so you can also give "name": "jay" 
both are correct 

// we can also access like 
obj["gender"]; 
// in square bracket we have to pass like string 



// suppose if we give key "name of"
// now it can only be accessed by square bracket
