Math is the object only 

what is Math a global object


ChatGPT said:
Yes! ‚úÖ

üîπ Math is a built-in global object in JavaScript.
It provides mathematical constants and functions, but it's not a constructor ‚Äî you cannot do new Math().

üìå Key Points about Math:
Global: Always available without importing.

Static only: You call methods like Math.sqrt(), not on an instance.

Not a function or constructor: typeof Math returns "object".

‚úÖ Example usage:
js
Copy code
console.log(Math.PI);           // 3.14159...
console.log(Math.sqrt(25));     // 5
console.log(Math.floor(4.9));   // 4
console.log(Math.random());     // Random number between 0 and 1
‚ùå You cannot do:
js
Copy code
new Math();  // TypeError: Math is not a constructor
‚úÖ typeof Math
js
Copy code
console.log(typeof Math);  // "object"
üîç Internal structure:
Math is like a static utility object, with:

Properties like Math.E, Math.LN2, Math.PI

Methods like Math.abs(), Math.pow(), Math.max(), Math.min(), etc.

üîö TL;DR:
‚úÖ Yes, Math is a global, static object

‚ùå Not instantiable

üßÆ Provides mathematical operations/constants

what are all global objects


ChatGPT said:
Excellent question! Let's break this down.

‚úÖ What Are Global Objects in JavaScript?
Global objects are available in all scopes without needing to import or require them. They are part of the JavaScript global execution context.

In browsers, these are accessible via the window object.

üß† Some Common Global Objects in JavaScript:
Category	Global Object	Description
‚úÖ Utility	Math	Provides math functions/constants
‚úÖ Utility	JSON	For parsing and stringifying JSON
‚úÖ Utility	console	Used for debugging (e.g., console.log)
‚úÖ Utility	Intl	Internationalization support
‚úÖ Utility	Reflect	Low-level object operations
‚úÖ Utility	Atomics	For atomic operations in SharedArrayBuffer
‚úÖ Utility	WebAssembly	For interacting with WebAssembly modules
‚úÖ Timing	setTimeout / setInterval	Timer functions
‚úÖ Promise	Promise	For asynchronous programming
‚úÖ Data Types	Object, Function, Boolean, Symbol, BigInt	Constructors for data types
‚úÖ Number Types	Number, BigInt	Numeric wrappers
‚úÖ String & Array	String, Array, RegExp	For strings, arrays, regex
‚úÖ Errors	Error, TypeError, SyntaxError, etc.	Error types
‚úÖ Global	window (Browser) / global (Node.js)	The global context object
‚úÖ Others	eval, isNaN, parseInt, encodeURI, etc.	Global functions

üñ•Ô∏è In Browser, you can list global objects:
js
Copy code
console.log(Object.getOwnPropertyNames(window));
In Node.js:

js
Copy code
console.log(Object.getOwnPropertyNames(global));
üîé Are all built-in objects global?
Yes ‚Äî built-ins like Math, Date, Array, String, etc., are automatically available globally.

‚ùó null and undefined are not objects:
null is a primitive

undefined is a primitive

But undefined is a global property, not an object.

üîö TL;DR:
Global objects are always available without importing

Include: Math, JSON, console, setTimeout, Promise, and all constructors like Array, Object, Function, etc.

Accessible through window (browser) or global (Node.js)

You said:
global is part of object.prototype or what


ChatGPT said:
Great question! Let‚Äôs break it down clearly:

‚ùì Is global (or window) part of Object.prototype?
‚úÖ No, global / window is not part of Object.prototype.
üîç Here's what actually happens:
global (in Node.js) and window (in browsers) are the global objects ‚Äî the top-level scope.

They are instances of Object, but they are not inherited from Object.prototype in the prototype chain sense.

Object.prototype is just a prototype that other objects inherit properties/methods from.

‚ö†Ô∏è Important distinctions:
Concept	Description
Object.prototype	The base prototype object ‚Äî from which most JS objects inherit.
window / global	The global environment object, which holds all global variables/functions.
window instanceof Object	‚úÖ true ‚Äî because window is an object
Object.prototype.isPrototypeOf(window)	‚úÖ true ‚Äî confirms inheritance chain
window === Object.prototype	‚ùå false ‚Äî they are not the same thing

‚úÖ Example in Browser:
js
Copy code
console.log(typeof window);                    // "object"
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(window));    // [object Window] ‚Üí browser-specific object
console.log(Object.prototype.isPrototypeOf(window)); // true
‚úÖ Example in Node.js:
js
Copy code
console.log(typeof global);                    // "object"
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(global));    // {}
console.log(Object.prototype.isPrototypeOf(global)); // true
‚úÖ TL;DR:
‚ùå global / window is not part of Object.prototype

‚úÖ But they are objects and inherit from Object.prototype

They are the top-level global environment objects in their respective JS runtimes

You said:
so where are they stored 


ChatGPT said:
Great ‚Äî let‚Äôs go deep into this.

‚ùì Where are global (Node.js) and window (browser) stored?
‚úÖ They are created by the JavaScript runtime environment and represent the global execution context ‚Äî not stored inside any object ‚Äî rather, they are the top-most object themselves.
üîπ Think of it this way:
In browsers, the global object is window.

In Node.js, the global object is global.

In modern JS (ES2020+), globalThis is a unified way to access the global object in any environment.

üß† So where are they stored?
They‚Äôre not stored inside some object ‚Äî instead, they are the root object of the entire runtime.

‚úÖ Browser Environment:
js
Copy code
console.log(window);         // The global object
console.log(window.window);  // points to itself
console.log(window === this); // true (in global scope)
In browsers:

All global variables are actually properties of window

var x = 5; ‚Üí creates window.x = 5

‚úÖ Node.js Environment:
js
Copy code
console.log(global); // The global object
In Node:

Global variables (not declared with let/const) attach to global

But unlike browsers, var x = 5; does not create global.x

‚úÖ ES2020+ Cross-environment Global:
js
Copy code
console.log(globalThis);               // Always works!
console.log(globalThis === window);    // true (in browser)
console.log(globalThis === global);    // true (in Node)
‚úÖ globalThis is the official, standard way to refer to the global object regardless of environment.

‚úÖ TL;DR:
Environment	Global Object	"Stored" Where?
Browser	window	It is the global object ‚Äî root of everything
Node.js	global	Same ‚Äî the root global object
ES2020+	globalThis	‚úÖ Standard access to the global object
Object.prototype?	‚ùå Not stored there	But global object inherits from it
